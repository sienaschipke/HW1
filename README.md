# <Homework-1>

## Description

I worked on this project to increase the accessibility and SEO for a marketing company, Horiseon. The primary updates were to update the HTML tags from mostly divs to respective semantic elements. Additionally, some changes were made the the CSS file to reduce duplicative code.

## Usage

This project is a good basis point for increasing the accessibility of a website with properly chosen and ordered semantic elements.
